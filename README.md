# Imixs-Metrics

Imixs-Metrics extends the [Imixs-Workflow platform](https://www.imixs.org) with comprehensive analytics capabilities that transform workflow data into actionable business insights. The project enables organizations to understand not only how their processes perform operationally, but also what economic impact they have on the business.

## Project Goal

Traditional workflow systems excel at coordinating work but provide limited visibility into process economics. Imixs-Metrics bridges this gap by combining operational analytics with business value tracking. Organizations can finally see the complete picture of their processes: how often they run, how well they perform, what they cost, and what value they generate.

## Modules

### [Imixs Metrics Monitor](./imixs-metrics-monitor/README.md)

This module provides operational analytics for Imixs-Workflow processes. It tracks workflow executions, event frequencies, and performance patterns to help organizations identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation, and improve process efficiency. It integrates seamlessly with standard monitoring platforms like Prometheus and Grafana, enabling real-time process monitoring and alerting within existing IT infrastructures.

Key benefits include complete visibility into process execution patterns, performance bottleneck identification, and data-driven capacity planning based on actual workflow usage.

### [Imixs Metrics Business](./imixs-metrics-business/README.md)

This module introduces a revolutionary approach to process management by enabling organizations to capture costs and values directly within their BPMN models. This transforms static process diagrams into dynamic business intelligence tools that reveal the true economics of process execution.

With this module, organizations can annotate workflow activities with associated costs, such as processing expenses or resource consumption, and track value generation like captured discounts or customer satisfaction improvements. The module supports both fixed values and dynamic calculations based on process data, adapting to various business scenarios.

The primary advantage is the ability to make informed business decisions based on process economics rather than operational metrics alone. Organizations can calculate ROI for process improvements, identify cost drivers, and optimize processes for value creation rather than just efficiency.

## Combined Impact

When used together, these modules provide unprecedented process transparency. While Workflow Metrics reveals that an invoice process handles 500 documents monthly with an average processing time of three days, Value Metrics adds that this costs 7,750 EUR while potentially generating 50,000 EUR in early payment discounts. This complete picture enables strategic decisions about automation investments, process redesign, and resource allocation based on actual business impact.
